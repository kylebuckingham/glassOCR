A simple text analyzer for Google glass. This is currently not functioning, and only here for collaboration purposes.

Install instructions:

Please note that Launchy is required for this to work. This works perfectly for me, but I cannot be held responsible if you break your device. If you do not know what you are doing then I recommend that you have an experienced friend install it for you or take some time and learn to do it yourself.

1. Compile the APK using your favorite IDE

2. Make sure that you have put your Glass into Debug Mode

3. Plug your Glass in and push the APK using adb with 'adb install stardroid-glass.apk'
